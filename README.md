# 🚗 DIY Robotic Car Using Custom Motor Driver

This project is a fully working **DIY robotic car** built using a **custom-designed motor driver**, breadboard prototype electronics, relays, Li-ion battery pack, and a microcontroller for speed and direction control.

The car is completely hand-assembled and tested on a breadboard, making it a great learning project for embedded systems and motor control.

## 🧩 Hardware Used

- 2× DC gear motors with wheels  
- Custom motor driver (homemade)  
- ESP32 / Arduino (depending on your build)  
- Breadboards  
- Jumper wires  
- Relays  
- Li-ion batteries  
- Battery holder and connectors  
- Switches, diodes, resistors, capacitors

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The microcontroller sends **PWM signals** to the custom motor driver.
2. The driver controls the motors for **forward**, **reverse**, or **stop**.
3. Relays (optional) handle switching and protection.
4. Li-ion batteries provide portable power to the entire system.
5. All wiring is mounted on a small car chassis.
